## [dev/mvp-2] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- `team-lead`, `system-analyst`, `template-maintainer`, and `changelog` agents, synced from the upstream `nestjs-project-template` delivery-workflow update — establishes a role-based delivery pipeline (classify → plan → implement → review → changelog → publish)
- `.claude/settings.json` — `SessionStart` hook that has `team-lead` run one `template-maintainer` proposal-mode audit per session
- `.claude/template-sync-state.json` — bookmark tracking the last upstream commit reviewed/applied against this project's Claude instructions

### Updated
- `CLAUDE.md` — added a "Delivery Workflow" section defining `team-lead` as the workflow owner and the allowed agent delegation paths
- `README.md` — added a "Claude Agent Workflow" section documenting all agents and the delegation flow
- `repo-publisher` agent — now runs `changelog` before committing a significant change
